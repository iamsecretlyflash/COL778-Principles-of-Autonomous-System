# COL778 - Principles of Autonomous System
This repository ccontains assignments, lecture notes, books and other resources for the course [COL778](https://lily-molybdenum-65d.notion.site/COL778-Principles-of-Autonomous-Systems-eb895fb5ac0d4edc860533439cce8fa7)/[864](https://lily-molybdenum-65d.notion.site/COL864-Special-Topics-in-AI-Embodied-AI-28e0e65bfef34ee8a9905375f5e419b3) offered by [Prof. Rohan Paul](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rohanpaul/index.html) in the semester 2302 at IITD. The [course](https://lily-molybdenum-65d.notion.site/COL778-Principles-of-Autonomous-Systems-eb895fb5ac0d4edc860533439cce8fa7) deals with the algorithmic aspects of intelligent robotics and more generally autonomous systems.

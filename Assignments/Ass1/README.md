# State Estimation using Kalman Filters

## File descriptions
1) Q1.py contains the implementation of the basic agent and linear Kalman Filter. It estimates the trjectory of an aeroplane with noisy observation sensors
2) 

## Instructions for running the assignment files

1) Requirements :
   ```
   pip3 install plotly
   pip3 install numpy
   pip3 install matplotlib
   ```
2) Run Q1.py in the terminal as :
   ```
   python3 Q1.py
   ```
3) The HTML Plots and PNGs will be generated and stored inside the PLOTS folder
4) Run the other python files similaraly and their plots will also be stored in the same location
